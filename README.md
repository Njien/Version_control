BASIC CALCULATOR FOR SIMPLE ADDITION.

VERSION1: created two variables and stored values in them, and the third variable to store the summation of the two variables i created.

VERSION2: i fixed a logical error. That is instead of hard coding my values,i decided to get them from the user.

VERSION3: the calculator was collecting the input as strings values, which was not supposed to be so. so i typecasted the input to int and float.

VERSION4: I fixed a value error. typcasting an int with a float value. so i fixed that error.

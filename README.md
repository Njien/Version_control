BASIC CALCULATOR FOR SIMPLE ADDITION.

VERSION1: created to variables and stored values in them, and the third variable to store the summation of the to variables i created.

VERSION2: i fixed a logical error. That is instead of hard coding my values,i decided to get them from the user.

VERSION3: the calculator as collecting the input as strings values, hich as not supposed to be so. so i typecasted the input to int and float.

VERSION4: I fixed a value e rror. typcasting an int ith a float value. so i fixed that error.
